# SpecterTrace
SpecterTrace is a lightweight metadata extraction tool that reveals hidden data in images, documents, and PDFs like GPS coordinates, timestamps, device info, and author tags. Built for OSINT analysts, journalists, and red teamers who know: every file leaves a trace. “If you want to find the source, follow the shadows.”
